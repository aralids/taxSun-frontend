## How to use

## How to download and run locally

Occasionally, especially if your TSV file contains > 10,000 unique taxIDs, the remote backend might give up on it and fail to load your data. In this case, you can run the program locally and avoid a time-out. Please note that the processing of your file might still need a couple of minutes depending on how diverse your metagenome is.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide assumes that you already have Python and Node.js/npm installed on your machine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NCBI taxonomy database gets regularly updated and is unusable for a couple of hours.

1. Download and unzip the code from this repository into a new folder (referred to as "frontend folder" from now on)
2. Download and unzip the code from [the backend repository](https://github.com/aralids/taxSun-fastAPI-backend) into another folder (referred to as "backend folder" from now on)

3. Open a terminal in the backend folder and run the following commands:
   - `python -m venv venv` (to create a virtual environment)
   - `source venv/bin/activate` for Linux/MacOS or `venv\Scripts\activate` for Windows (to start the virtual environment)
   - `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (to install all dependencies within the environment)
   - `python -m uvicorn main:app` (to run the backend)
   
   It might take a few minutes to load the NCBI taxonomy database, after which the backend will be running at http://localhost:8000.

4. Open a second terminal in the frontend folder and run the following commands:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run build`
   - `npm run preview`
     
   The frontend will usually be hosted at http://localhost:4173, or on another port if this one is not available. Open it and use taxSun like you would the deployed version.
