## How to use

## How to dowload and run locally

Occasionally, if your TSV file contains > 10,000 unique taxIDs, the remote backend might give up on it and fail to load your data. In this case, you can run the program locally and avoid a time-out. Please note that the processing of your file might still need a couple of minutes depending on how diverse your metagenome is.

This guide assumes that you already have Python and Node.js/npm installed on your machine.

For Windows:

- Download the code from this repository into a folder called "taxSun-frontend"
- Download the code from [the backend repository](https://github.com/aralids/taxSun-backend) into a folder called "taxSun-backend"
- Open a terminal in the "taxSun-backend" folder and run the following commands: `python install requirements.txt`, `set FLASK_APP=main.py`, `python -m flask run`. It might take a few minutes to load the NCBI taxonomy database, after which the backend will be running at http://localhost:8080.
- Open a second terminal in the "taxSun-frontend" folder and run the following commands: `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm run preview`. The frontend will usually be hosted at http://localhost:5173, or on another port if this one is not available. Visit it and use taxSun like you would the deployed version.
